            <!-- Part 1 -->
            <div class="script-part active" id="part1">
                <div class="script-line">Good morning, I'm Suryansh Yadav. I've always loved building things — robotics, coding, and game development were my hobbies.</div>
                <div class="script-line">Two years ago, I went to Kota to study. Life there became very intense. I stopped my hobbies, mostly stayed in my room, and focused only on books and sleep. Slowly, I isolated myself and started living in darkness.</div>
                <div class="script-line">During that time, I kept a pet rabbit, Kanha, for company. One day, I completely forgot to feed him for 24 hours because I was lost in myself. His health got worse, and I had to send him to a zoo. Losing him taught me how isolation and lack of support can affect life.</div>
                <div class="script-line">After two months, my physics teacher noticed I had missed several tests and came to my room. She encouraged me to restart my hobbies and offered me a small team 3 girls and 2 boys. I taught them robotics and coding from scratch, and together we prepared for a competition in Jaipur. We were in 9th grade, but we defeated teams from IIT Kanpur and many others.</div>
                <div class="script-line">During that event, one of my female teammates got her first period. She was nervous, unprepared, and scared. That night, we discussed how huge the problem is — there's no real innovation, no safety, and millions of women face this every month.</div>
                <div class="script-line">It wasn't just that even simple things like going out safely were a challenge. On one trip, some drunk men misbehaved with our senior didi while she was returning from an outing. That made us realize how much this issue affects women's everyday life from safety to hygiene and how little effort is put into solving it.</div>
                <div class="script-line">That's when I decided to build something that actually makes a difference.</div>
            </div>

            <!-- Part 2 -->
            <div class="script-part" id="part2">
                <div class="script-line">The SmartFem designed for women, with health and comfort in mind.</div>
                <div class="script-line">A smart menstrual cup that tracks cycles, monitors pH, and helps stay safe and stress-free.</div>
                <div class="script-line">And here's the challenge we often overlook.</div>
                <div class="script-line">Periods are often seen as just a personal issue, but they have a much bigger impact. Menstrual hygiene isn't only about health it's a growing environmental and social crisis worldwide.</div>
                <div class="script-line">Every year, billions of disposable pads and tampons are thrown away, ending up in landfills, oceans, and rivers. Made of plastic and chemicals, some take up to 800 years to break down.</div>
                <div class="script-line">One woman alone uses over 10,000 menstrual products in her lifetime just one person. Imagine the mountains of waste, releasing toxic chemicals into soil and water. Drainage systems clog, landfills overflow, and in rural areas, burning or burying these products pollutes the environment further.</div>
                <div class="script-line">It's not just the planet poor awareness, sanitation, and access lead to unsafe practices. Many women reuse disposables or face infections. Emotional stress, stigma, and discomfort are common every month.</div>
                <div class="script-line">So, this isn't just about pads or products it's about how we care for ourselves and our planet.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="script-part" id="part3">
                <div class="script-line">Now that we've seen the problem, here's our solution — SmartFem Cup.</div>
                <div class="script-line">A complete period care system built with advanced intelligence, sustainability, and privacy-first architecture.</div>
                <div class="script-line">Made from medical-grade silicone with a UV-C self-sterilization case, it integrates with Artemis AI a fine-tuned, open-source neural framework enhanced with federated learning and graph-based analytics for cycle tracking, emergency alerts, SOS transmission, and real-time health monitoring.</div>
                <div class="script-line">The SOS module uses an Iridium satellite transceiver and connects via BLE and GNSS protocols, ensuring global coverage through LEO constellations even if your phone has no mobile or Wi-Fi network.</div>
                <div class="script-line">It reduces waste from over 10,000 pads in a lifetime, prevents infections, and lasts over 10 years. Our packaging is fully biodegradable and embedded with seed-growth tech that turns into flowers.</div>
                <div class="script-line">We empower women through our donate-a-cup initiative, mesh-based support networks, and voice-assisted interfaces, while securing all personal data including SOS packets and location metadata with AES-256 encryption.</div>

                <div class="script-line">It tracks real-time health data, ensures hygiene with UV sterilization, and charges wirelessly both standard and fast.</div>
                <div class="script-line">Every component is built for efficiency and reliability.</div>

            <div class="script-part" id="part5">
                <div class="script-line">Now that you've seen how the SmartFem Infinity X works and what makes it unique, let me show you a quick video we created to explain it better.</div>
                <div class="script-line">I have created it with the help of my friend. With your permission, I'd like to show this video now.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="script-part" id="part6">
                <div class="script-line">That's all from my side. I hope this gave you a clear idea of how the SmartFem Infinity X is redefining menstrual care. I'm happy to take any questions you have.</div>
